:pushpin: Explaining further the idea here, it is very simple:

* This project have a goal to **celebrate the diversity and the culture all around the world**, so more than to write just the basic "Hello, World" that every one of us do when we first start to code, I wish that people that speak other languages besides English can type this two simple words, greeting the World :earth_asia: in your mother tongue. Let's begin!

* First, add a <code>hello_world_yourusername.xx</code> script to the <code>scripts</code> directory in any programming language of your choice. Here is my example:
```
// Programming Language: JavaScript
// Native Language: Portuguese
// Author: Carolina Calixto
// Github: https:github.com/calixtocarolina

console.log('Olá, Mundo!');
```
* Name the file <code>hello_world_yourusername.xx</code>, e.g, <code>hello_world_calixtocarolina.js</code> or <code>hello_world_calixtocarolina.kt</code>.
* Don't forget to include your native language and feel free to include additional information about the programming language you choose in your comments! You can add useful links, tutorials, introduction to the language. Any tips are very welcomed. 
* Be assured to be respectful and kind. Comments, issues or PRs that can be interpreted as rude or disrespectful to other people will be deleted/not accepted. Constructive critics are welcomed. Everybody can learn together, as long respect is the major value bonding us as a community.
